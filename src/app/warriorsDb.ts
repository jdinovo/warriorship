    resultDescription: 'Gliding through life as a warm, summer breeze, your spiritual essence promotes a pervasive ' +
      'calm over all social interactions, ensuring peaceful outcomes, even in volatile confrontations. Difficult ' +
      'moments in life are welcomed as intellectual challenges with opportunities to find grace, since you believe ' +
      'life is pre-ordained. You are an effective communicator, and your colourful orations have a profound and ' +
      'constructive impact on the masses. People seek your compassionate guidance, and faithfully comply with your ' +
      'considered advice. You are generous to fault, working quietly and diligently without compromise, to fulfill ' +
      'all self-imposed responsibilities, often at great expense to your personal well-being.',
    aboutDescription: 'Monks practice religious asceticism, abstaining from sensual pleasure in the pursuit of ' +
      'spirituality, and living their lives in absolute solitude or only in the company of other monks. Monks ' +
      'originated in 495 BC, with the construction of the Shaolin Temple. In 502 AD, Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk ' +
      'from India, taught meditative postures resembling animals to the monks, in order to improve their physical ' +
      'conditioning. This early form of formal, structured exercise evolved into the development of Kung Fu, as ' +
      'the monks required effective self defence, to protect themselves from predators, who sought to harm and ' +
      'rob them. The Shaolin Kung Fu systems of postures and movements were originally based on five animals: ' +
      'tiger, crane, leopard, snake, and dragon.',

    resultDescription: 'The Viking spirit is overwhelming and often intimidating, with your brawny physicality ' +
      'and bravado. Your presentation is tactically strategic. Unbridled hubris, you feel no need for questions ' +
      'or clarity. You are reactive and impulsive, but you consistently and reliably get the task done, at any cost. ' +
      'Life is a zero-sum game and “winner-takes-all”. Most days are pure high-octane, adrenaline-induced thrill ' +
      'rides, but some friends and family find your volatility more terrifying than exciting.',
    aboutDescription: 'The compelling and violent legends, of the formidably fierce Vikings, are not entirely ' +
      'accurate. Norsemen were farmers in the early stages of their history, who would trade, hunt and fish, ' +
      'as well. Vikings had excellent design, carpentry and engineering skills, and constructed symmetrical, ' +
      'strong ships, with the ability to swiftly change their bearings alter course. These massive vessels were ' +
      'superior to any other on water, at the time, and provided the Vikings’ greatest tactical advantage. ' +
      'Viking fleets were embellished with ominous designs and intimidating mythological characters and symbols, ' +
      'complimented by terrifying battle cries, to instil fear and panic in their adversaries, which escalated ' +
      'with each successive invasion. In the 8th century, Vikings began riding the ocean waves on their superior ' +
      'ships, and raiding ever more distant territories, for land, treasure, food and supplies. Eventually, ' +
      'different Viking tribes separated and dispersed to modern day Iceland, Greenland and even Canada. Unlike ' +
      'other explorers and disseminating races, Vikings remained true to their way of life and beliefs, ' +
      'throughout each generation.',

    resultDescription: 'Agile and situationally adept, your suave knightly comportment commands respect, ' +
      'humbling all in your noble presence. Confrontation is a complex yet seductive dance, elaborately ' +
      'choreographed with each element researched and analyzed to the infinite minutiae. Effervescent ' +
      'charisma and gilded fancy footwork, scintillating hypnotic, distract while the deft slight-of-hand ' +
      'deals the lethal blow. Hero to all, even your formidable foes fall in awe, acknowledging defeat with ' +
      'a bemused smirk.',
    aboutDescription: 'Knight originally referred to professional calvary men. The Knecht Hospitaller and ' +
      'The Knights Templar were well-known rivals with a colourful history. In 1023, the Knecht Hospitaller ' +
      'were labourers or servants at the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, caring for holy pilgrims who ' +
      'became weak or ill. The Knecht Hospitaller transformed into the Order of Knights of the Hospital of ' +
      'Saint John of Jerusalem, after the first crusade in 1099, armed to protect the patients in the ' +
      'hospital, as well as pilgrims travelling to and from the Holy Land. Today they are known as the ' +
      'Knights of Malta. The Templar Knights came into existence in 1119, and quickly grew immensely ' +
      'popular, receiving donations and securing the wealth of rich, powerful, and influential people ' +
      'when they travelled. These transactions formally evolved into modern banking.',

      'evaluated, outcomes are irrelevant. Winning is the journey, not the destination. You like a ' +
      'challenge and tenaciously toil to overcome any and all obstacles. A natural team leader, ' +
      'you strive to control everything in your life, even in situations that are beyond your ' +
      'control. You are frugal, but your honour is priceless, never to be bartered or sold. ' +
      'Uncompromising, it must be a honourable life, or no life at all. Surely, you must ' +
      'recognize these lofty ideals, excessive standards, and exceptional goals, are often unattainable. ' +
      'A teflon exterior belies your perpetually discordant, internalized stress —an emotional volcano ' +
      'percolating on the precipice of eruption.',
    aboutDescription: 'Samurai were an elite class of stoic warriors, dating back to 1338, ' +
      'who valued honour above all else. All samurai were mandated to comply with an unwritten code. ' +
      'This code was eventually scribed over the centuries, accumulating contributions from the many ' +
      'esteemed descendants of original Samurai. This Bushido (Way of the Warrior) was a set of rules ' +
      'and guidelines delineating the behaviour criteria for respect, loyalty, benevolence, and courage. ' +
      'Upon dishonouring this code, Samurai would commit ritual suicide, known as Seppuku (self-disembowelment). ' +
      'Samurai who lost their masters were known as Ronin (Wandering Knight).'
